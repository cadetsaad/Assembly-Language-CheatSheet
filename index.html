        <h2>Interrupts</h2>
        <p>Interrupts are software-generated events that can be triggered by both hardware and software. In MS-DOS
            Assembly Language, interrupts are commonly used for interacting with the operating system and hardware
            components.</p>

                    operand.</td>
                <td> <code>LEA SI, array</code></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Arithmetic and Logic</h2>
        <p>Arithmetic and logic instructions perform mathematical and logical operations on data.</p>
        <table>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>CALL, RET</td>
                <td>Procedure Calls and Returns - CALL is used to call a procedure or subroutine, and RET is used to
                    return from a procedure.</td>
                <td> <code>CALL subroutine</code></td>
            </tr>

        <h2>Procedures (PROC) and Macros (MACRO)</h2>
        <p>Procedures and macros provide a way to modularize code and reuse it across the program.</p>
        <p>In assembly language, a procedure is a named block of code that performs a specific task. It can be called
            from other parts of the program.</p>
        <p>A macro is a named block of code that is expanded inline wherever it is invoked. Macros are often used for
            code repetition or to define complex instructions.</p>
        <p>Here's an example of defining and using a procedure and a macro:</p>
        <pre>
        PROC procedure_name
            ; Procedure body
            ret
        ENDP

        MACRO macro_name parameters
            ; Macro body
        ENDM
        </pre>
